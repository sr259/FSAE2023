# FSAE2023

This repository contains the Arduino code and sample data used for collecting temperature and acceleration data from a car. The data was collected using a Teensy 4.1 microprocessor along with four MLX90614 temperature sensors and one Parallax tri-axis accelerometer. The objective of this project was to gather additional data that the Megasquirt system was unable to provide.

Purpose
The primary purpose of this data collection was to analyze the temperature and acceleration patterns of the car during testing phases. By examining the temperature data collected from the tires and combining it with the acceleration data, we aimed to identify the optimal tire temperature for improved performance during turns. The intention was to warm the tires to the identified temperature during competitions, thereby maximizing the car's maneuverability during turns.
